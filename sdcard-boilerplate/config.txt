# On some RPi firmwares this will prevent a low GPIO3 from putting the RPi

# "By default, a probe on the I2C bus will happen at startup, even when
# a PoE HAT is not attached. Setting this option to 1 disables control of
# a PoE HAT fan through I2C (on pins ID_SD & ID_SC). If you are not intending
# to use a PoE HAT doing this is useful if you need to minimise boot time."
#
# In our situation, we may use Pi HATs, but we aren't booting into NOOBS or

# Thus we can enjoy some boot-time speed up, or whatever other benefits
# might be conferred by disabling this logic.
# (That may even allow us to us ID_SC and ID_SD as I2C pins, thus allowing
# us to use TWO (identially-addressed) I2C peripherals with the RPi, which
# is nice. This configuration option probably isn't necessary for that, though.)
